P - Problem

Make an application that allows us to keep track of pets at a pet adoption agency.

Create an application that allows us to:

CRUD
- Create: Add (create) a new pet that is available for adoption
- Read: Get lists of pets that are available for adoption - perhaps by different attributes.
- Update: Update information about a pet that is available for adoption
- Delete: Remove a pet upon adoption

E - Examples:

- Species (Cat, Dog, Bird) - string
- Gender - string
- Age - int
- Name - string
- Color - string
- Size - string

| Species | Gender | Age | Name    | Color  | Size   |
| ------- | ------ | --- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| Dog     | Female | 1   | Sadie   | Blonde | Medium |
| Cat     | Male   | 3   | Russell | Black  | Small  |
| Dog     | Male   | 3   | Kodak   | White  | Large  |

D - Data

Clearly, we have a `Pet` -- likely a class!

Also, we will have a `List` of `Pet`



A - Algorithm

Welcome the user to the application

While the user hasn't quit the application

Show them a menu of options they can do

- Add a new pet
- See all the pets up for adoption
- Input a name of a pet that has been adopted to remove them from the list
- Input a name of a pet and update their size
- Quit the application
